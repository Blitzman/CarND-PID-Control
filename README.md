Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Requirements

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* Udacity Simulator [Download link](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

## Compilation and Execution

1. Clone this repo
2. cd to repo root dir.
3. `mkdir build`
4. `cd build`
5. `cmake ..`
6. `make`
7. `./UnscentedKF`
8. Run simulator

## Rubric

### Compiling

#### Your code should compile

### Implementation

#### The PID procedure follows what was taught in the lessons

### Reflection

#### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation

#### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen

### The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track

#### No tire may leave the drivable portion of the track surface. The car may not pop up onto ledges or roll over any surfaces that would otherwise be considered unsafe (if humans were in the vehicle)
